## Installation 

If running locally make sure you have node.js installed and then run setup.bat if you're using a host like replit go to the console and type "npm i" into it to create a webhook run client.js on any device since it'll update db and then copy the id and input it to the end of your url eg (https://url.com/<id>) and then run server.js on your host and then in anything u want to enter the webhook for rather than typing the discord url type your new api endpoint
